Planning and designing the process took me around around 2hours while on vacation.
I was thinking a very straight forward solution based on the logic specified.

As I started implementing what I formulated in my mind, I did trial and error with python list to 
support negative and positive input. It took me around  4hrs on and off.

I enountered several bugs along the way with negative and positive input when entering 20+ number.
So I did debugging and resolved error. Debugging/Fixing bugs took like around 1hr.

Direct subsitution is a bit easy so it doesn't take so long.
I created the test cases after to make sure everything works as expected.
